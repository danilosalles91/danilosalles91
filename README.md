## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br>
<br>
Hi, I'm Danilo Salles, a Business Administration graduate with extensive experience in the banking sector. 
Currently transitioning into tech as a Future Full Stack Developer, studying at DevClub. 
Iâ€™m passionate about building intuitive digital experiences and writing clean, maintainable code. 
My skill set includes:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into React, Node.js, and TypeScript. 
Here youâ€™ll find projects that showcase how I transform ideas into functional solutions while continuously improving my front-end and back-end skills
